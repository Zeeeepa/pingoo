# TLS



## TLS version support

By design, pingoo only supports TLS 1.3 (and up in the future).

TLS 1.3 was introduced in 2018 and is supported by virtually all browsers and client libraries: https://caniuse.com/tls1-3. Only abandonned bots gone rogue don't support TLS 1.3, therefore it makes not sense to reduce the security of users only to support these bots.
